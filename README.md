This document will provide you with all the necessary information to get started with HTML and CSS, the basic building blocks of the web.

Installation
To use HTML and CSS, you don't need to install anything. All you need is a text editor and a web browser.

Getting Started
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to create the structure of web pages. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages.

Here's how to create a simple HTML page:

Open a text editor such as Notepad or Sublime Text.
Type the following code:
php
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
	<p>This is my first HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>
Save the file with a .html extension.
To style this page using CSS, you can add a style block in the head section of the HTML file. Here's an example:

php
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>My First HTML Page</title>
	<style>
		h1 {
			color: blue;
			font-size: 24px;
		}
		p {
			color: green;
			font-size: 16px;
		}
	</style>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
	<p>This is my first HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>
This will change the color and font size of the h1 and p elements on the page.
